# IORAnalysis

The IORAnalysis module is designed to run on a windows PC with WinDesign 4 and AutoIT installed. Without those it cannot function fully.

## Installation

IORAnalysis can be installed through pip:

``` pip install https://github.com/JohnCHarrington/IORAnalysis ```

If you wish to develop it further, clone this repository to your desktop, navigate to it in a terminal and install:

``` pip install -e . ```

This will allow you to make changes without having to reinstall the module every time.
